      <p>
        Over the years, I have stumbled upon a <strong>great interest</strong> in the workings of coding and the entirety of the technological realm but never gotten the chance to pursue that path...until <strong>now</strong>.
        Jumping to the present time, I have been working in the healthcare as a radiographer for quiet some time given the chance I have gained suffient knowledge and skills sets in my field of work. 
        Working in such an analytical and dynamic environment, I felt the need to expand upon my creative side which I have neglected for years.
        <br>
        <br>
        My main focus currently would be to build the basic fundamentals of coding and understanding the workings of it whilist balancing it between my full-time occupation.
        My end goal would be breaking through the computing industry and becoming a fron-end web developer.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my spare time, I do love to do the occasional doodling, embroidering on clothing or bags....and chilling with my collection of homegrown succulents ðŸª´ðŸª´
