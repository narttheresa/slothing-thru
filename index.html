          <p>
            Over the years, I have stumbled upon a <strong>great interest</strong> in the workings of coding and the entirety of the technological realm but never gotten the chance to pursue that path...until <strong>now</strong>.
            Jumping to the present time, I have been working in the healthcare as a radiographer for quiet some time given the chance I have gained suffient knowledge and skills sets in my field of work. 
            Working in such an analytical and dynamic environment, I felt the need to expand upon my <strong>creative</strong> side which I have neglected for years.
            <br>
            <br>
            My main focus currently would be to <strong>build</strong> the basic fundamentals of coding and understanding the workings of it whilist balancing it between my full-time occupation.
            My end goal would be breaking through the computing industry and becoming a <strong>front-end web developer</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my spare time, I do love to do the occasional doodling, embroidering on clothing or bags....and chilling with my collection of homegrown succulents 🪴🪴

          <p>
            I am currently a full-time radiographer that specialises in CT and MRI imaging that provides optimal patient care and diagnostic imaging.<br>
            I have worked in both public and private sectors in the last current 7 years of my career.<br>
            It is a role that requires alot of <strong>improvisation and adaptation skills</strong> in achieving the required end results for the doctors.<br>

          <p>
            I have been dabbling in web development for about 3 months prior to commencing my current FE web development course.<br>
            I am always eager to expand more in this dynamic work industry!<br>
